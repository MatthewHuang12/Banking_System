Overview// Welcome to the Banking System Simulation repository! This project is an advanced C++ application that models a functional banking system. It showcases modern software engineering principles and demonstrates proficiency in object-oriented programming (OOP). This application is a perfect example of how complex systems can be efficiently managed and maintained using C++.

Features//

Object-Oriented Design: Adheres to OOP paradigms, encapsulating banking operations within distinct, modular classes.

Dynamic Memory Management: Utilizes pointers and dynamic allocation, ensuring efficient memory usage and management.

Robust Error Handling: Implements comprehensive error checking, ensuring the system's reliability and stability.

Data Persistence: Incorporates file input/output operations for persistent data storage, simulating real-world banking database systems.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides an interactive console-based interface for ease of use and accessibility.

Components//

Account Management: Facilitates operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiries.

Transaction Processing: Supports deposit and withdrawal operations, with transaction history tracking for auditing and review.

Interest Calculation: Implements interest accrual on account balances over specified time periods.

Money Transfer: Enables inter-account money transfers, simulating real-world banking transactions.

Data Storage: Reads and writes account data to and from external files, mimicking database interaction.

Technologies Used//

C++: Leveraged for its performance and OOP capabilities.

STL (Standard Template Library): Utilizes containers, iterators, and algorithms for efficient data manipulation.

File I/O: Employs file operations for reading and writing data, simulating database interactions.
